        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <p>
          Many software development engagement take one of two forms: Time and Materials or Fixed-Cost. We've found that both approaches can
          work in some circumstances, but both have their drawbacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drawing on our many years of Agile software development, and our deep understanding of Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and
          Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) principles, we have crafted an iterative approach that combines the best features of
          T&amp;M and fixed-cost with the time-tested{' '}

          methodology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever we can, we like to work in two-week iterations, during which time we deliver a small increment of functionality. Our goal
          is to deliver a minimally viable product, commonly called an "MVP" in as few iterations as possible. Ideally, even the first
          iteration will yield a product that can stand on its own and deliver some measure of{' '}

        <h4>Short-term engagement = low risk</h4>
        <p>
          Each iteration is an engagement. At the end of the two weeks, you own the code and can decide what to do next. If you like what
          we've done, we'll do another iteration. If it's not working for you, we'll just move on. Our goal is to continue on for as long as
          you feel like (or better yet, can prove) you're getting value for your investment.
        </p>
        <p>But how do we know what to build during the iteration? And what happens after the primary development work is done?</p>
        <p>
          In addition to our iterative development process, we offer hourly consulting services at a competitive rate. Before the work
          begins, we'll take the time to fully understand what's needed. And after the development process is complete, if anything comes
          up, we'll be glad to help. We can even provide on-site or computer-based training and documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In any case, before you're billed for any hours or for a two-week iteration, we'll get your approval on a Master Services
          Agreement to govern our interactions. There won't be any surprise bills.
        </p>
        <h4>The power of flexibility</h4>
        <p>
          We've found our iterative approach to be highly productive and cost-effective. It works well for us, and it provides good value
          and low risk for our clients.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, we understand that strategic IT investments often involve a number of decision-makers, and this approach may be
          unfamiliar to some who have only ever done fixed-cost or T&amp;M engagements. Because we're a small-scale operation, we're able to
          adjust our methodology to work with your needs.
