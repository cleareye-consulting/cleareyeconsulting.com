Astro has become a game-changer in the world of web development. As a consulting firm, we are always looking for tools that provide both a great developer experience and exceptional performance for our clients.

## Why Astro?

Astro's "island architecture" is the primary reason it stands out. Unlike traditional SPA frameworks that ship massive amounts of JavaScript to the browser, Astro sends zero JavaScript by default.

### Key Benefits:
- **Fast by default:** Static HTML is faster than hydrated JavaScript.
- **Framework agnostic:** Use React, Vue, Svelte, or just plain HTML/CSS.
- **Great DX:** Markdown support is built-in.

For developers, this means faster builds and easier maintenance. We've seen significant improvements in Lighthouse scores since migrating our core templates to Astro.
