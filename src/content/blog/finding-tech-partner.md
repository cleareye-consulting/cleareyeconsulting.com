Choosing a software consultant is more than just looking at a portfolio. It's about finding a partner who understands your goals and communicates effectively.

## Communication is Key

The best developers aren't just good at coding; they are good at listening. If a firm starts talking about technical stacks before they understand your business problem, that's a red flag.

### Check for these qualities:
- **Transparency:** Do they give honest timelines?
- **Domain Knowledge:** Have they worked in your industry?
- **Post-Launch Support:** What happens after the code is delivered?

A successful project is built on trust and clear expectations. In this post, we explore the interview questions you should ask every potential vendor.
